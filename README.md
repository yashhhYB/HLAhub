# 🧬 HLAhub – Where Healthtech Meets Blockchain, AI & Reddit

Welcome to **HLAhub**, a next-gen healthtech platform that matches organ donors and recipients using HLA data – all while celebrating these real-life heroes on Reddit. Think of it as Web2, Web3, and AI having a productive weekend together (with snacks, obviously 🍿).

## 🚀 What is HLAhub?

HLAhub is a decentralized, privacy-first organ matching platform that:

✅ Matches donors and recipients based on **HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen)** data  
✅ Uses **Algorand blockchain** to store verifiable matches and consent  
✅ Allows patients to **digitally sign their approval** via Algorand wallets  
✅ Rewards donors with **smart contract-triggered NFTs or payments**  
✅ Shares celebratory posts to Reddit using **Devvit SDK**  
✅ Runs on **Supabase + Bolt.new** – fast, scalable, and clean  

Basically, we're making organ donation **trustless**, **transparent**, and **totally community-powered**.

|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `Bolt.new`           | No-code/low-code builder for blazing-fast UI and logic  |
| `Supabase`           | Auth, database, storage, and Edge Functions              |
| `Algorand`           | Blockchain for secure, low-cost, eco-friendly records    |

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User uploads their HLA test report  
2. App matches them with compatible donors/recipients  
3. Blockchain stores match record, consent, and timestamp  
4. Smart contract triggers:
   - Payment (for verified donations)
   - NFT minting (Proof-of-Honor)
5. Reddit post celebrates the story publicly (with permission)

Yup, it’s part-matching engine, part-smart contract factory, part social shoutout machine 🔥

## 😎 Why We Built It

Organ donation is *literally life-saving*, but trust, transparency, and privacy are often missing.

With **blockchain**, **wallet-based consent**, and **AI-powered logic**, HLAhub brings peace of mind to a system where that really matters.

Plus… we wanted Reddit to celebrate these moments in the loudest, most wholesome way possible ❤️
